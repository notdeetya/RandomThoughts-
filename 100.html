<h2> WHY 77+33 SHOULD EQUAL 100 </h2>
    <p> If you are having a great day! Be prepared to be destroyed </p>
    <p> lets think about this logically first. I do understand why this ends up with the solution of 110. You do have to carry the 1.
      <p> 1s are stupid- </p>
      <p> um anyways.. Why do we have to say that this equals 110? Everyones brain goes straight to 100? Doesn't it just make math so much easier???</p>
      <p> So yeah thats my reasoning on why 77+33 should equal 100</p>
      <p>CIAO!!</P>

    <button onclick = "verify()"> Submit </button>
    <script> function verify(){
        var num = document.getElementById("number").value;
        if(num>100){result.value = "your number is greater than 100";}
       else{result.value = "your number is less than 100";}
}</script>
